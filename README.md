# A Roadmap to AI Engineer: From Scripts to AI Engineering

---

## Why: "Computational Biology is more or less becoming an Engineering Discipline, with AF is an excellent example."

I spent years writing Python scripts to analyze biological data. But the future of biology isn't just *analyzing* data—it's **building systems** that can reason, scale, and discover.

This repository documents my transition from "running scripts in a notebook" to **building production-grade AI systems**.

### My "Why"
1.  **The Shift:** Biology used to be about *analyzing* data. The future might shift towards *generating* it (AlphaFold, Diffusion Models) and verify them in the lab. 
2.  **The Scale:** Isolated scripts or software package don't scale. To support drug discovery, we need industrial-grade systems that run on thousands of GPUs, not a single laptop.
3.  **The Agentic Future:** LLMs aren't just chatbots; they are reasoning engines. I believe **AI Agents** will be the ones designing the next blockbuster drugs.

## 🗺️ The Roadmap: The 3 Pillars of AI Engineering

To bridge the gap from "Scientist" to "Engineer," I am focusing on three core pillars:

### ☁️ Pillar 1: Cloud & Infrastructure (The Foundation)
*Stop running on localhost. Start shipping.*
- **Goal:** deploy scalable, fault-tolerant systems on AWS/GCP.
- **Key Tech:** Docker, Kubernetes (K8s), Terraform, CI/CD (GitHub Actions).
- **Project:** Deployed **BioAgent** API on AWS ECS with auto-scaling.

### 🤖 Pillar 2: LLMs & Agentic AI (The Brain)
*Stop fine-tuning. Start orchestrating.*
- **Goal:** Build autonomous agents that can plan, use tools, and reason over scientific data.
- **Key Tech:** LangChain, LangGraph, Smolagents, RAG (Vector DBs).
- **Project:** **BioAgent** (Multi-agent researcher) & **DrugRAG** (Knowledge graph for drug discovery).

### 📈 Pillar 3: Scaling & Data Engineering (The Muscle)
*Stop using Pandas CSVs. Start using Spark.*
- **Goal:** Process massive biological datasets (Genomics/Cheminformatics) efficiently.
- **Key Tech:** Databricks (PySpark), Delta Lake, Nextflow, Snowflake.
- **Project:** **MolGen** pipeline processing 2M+ compounds on Databricks.

## 📝 The Protocol: How I Test Myself (The Gauntlet)

I don't just "watch tutorials." I test myself daily with rigorous engineering standards.

### 1. The Algorithm Gauntlet (LeetCode)
- **Goal:** 25 Problems/Day (Medium/Hard).
- **Focus:** Arrays, HashMaps, Trees, Graphs, DP.
- **Why:** To prove I can write optimized, bug-free code under pressure.

### 2. The SQL & Data Gauntlet (StrataScratch)
- **Goal:** Master complex SQL queries & data transformations.
- **Focus:** Window functions, complex joins, data cleaning.
- **Why:** Data is the fuel. If I can't query it efficiently, I can't build AI on top of it.

### 3. The System Design Gauntlet (Mock Interviews)
- **Goal:** Design scalable ML systems from scratch (e.g., "Design a Drug Discovery Platform").
- **Focus:** Trade-offs (Latency vs. Throughput), Data Pipelines, Serving Infrastructure.
- **Why:** Senior Engineers are hired for their design decisions, not just their code.
